# ybiproject
Objective: States the purpose of the recommender system.
Import Library: Imports the necessary Python libraries.
Import Data: Uses a small, hardcoded dataset for movies and ratings.
Describe Data: Displays the head and info of the datasets.
Data Preprocessing: Merges the datasets and creates a user-movie matrix.
Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X): In collaborative filtering, we focus on similarity rather than explicitly defining X and y.
Train Test Split: Skipped for simplicity.
Modeling: Calculates the cosine similarity matrix and defines a function to get movie recommendations.
Model Evaluation: For simplicity, this example just outputs recommendations.
Prediction: Generates and prints movie recommendations for a specified user.
